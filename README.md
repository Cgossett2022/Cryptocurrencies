# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
For this project, I used unsupervised machine learning to analyze various cryptocurrencies and determine how they could be grouped to create a classification system for an investment portfolio. In order to complete this project, I took the following steps: 

1. Preprocessed the Data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2. Reduced Data Dimensions Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
3. Clustered Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means 
4. Visualized Cryptocurrencies Results


## Results

### Preprocessed the Data for PCA

I used pandas to read in the data and build a crypto dataframe.

### Reduced Data Dimensions Using PCA

I built a new dataframe to which contains PC columns.
